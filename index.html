	<p>Myanimelist is a site that has the synopses of many different anime. While my site has information on the episode list and one of the characters, this site has information on what I have and more. It tells release dates, voice actors for characters, what light novels or manga the anime is based off of and over interesting information. My site only skims the surface.</p>
